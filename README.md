## About Vuetify Laravel Preset

View based templates.
Big bundle size
For a full, optimized, Vuetify build, refer to [Vuetify install](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/) with Vue-Cli

Caveat(s):
- Do not use short self-closing component syntax eg: `<component />`, use complete `<component></component>`.
- Every time DOM loads, there's a refresh. To avoid this, `router-view` can be used. Keeping as it is, for simplicity's sake.
